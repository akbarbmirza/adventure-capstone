  <p class="desc">
    It is Saturday afternoon and you-Savance- are dressed and ready waiting to get the night started. Everyone is meeting at the party for Akbar’s birthday except for Kevin. The doorbell rings and you hear Kevin knocking on the door. As you go to answer it, you see him on the porch, his neck elongates and he yells “Hoooooooooo!”

  <p class="desc">
    “Let’s get this party started,” Kevin says “You ready to go?”
  </p>

  <p class="desc">
    You are ready and as you walk out the front door, you ask Kevin,  “We have a decision to make…..how are we getting there?”
