    You decide to walk to the party.  There are a couple ways to go.  There is a shortcut you can take through the woods, but the woods are very dark and very scary.  Many horror stories have been told of teenagers going into these woods and nobody coming back.  Or worse, only one barely alive victim out of everyone who went in.  But the long way is soooooo very long.  Can you even get to the party in time?
